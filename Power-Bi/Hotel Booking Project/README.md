# Hotel Booking Dashboard - Power BI Project

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard created to analyze and visualize key insights related to hotel bookings. The project focuses on understanding booking patterns, customer behavior, and operational performance, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the hospitality industry.

## Project Overview

The **Hotel Booking Dashboard** presents various metrics and trends derived from a dataset of hotel bookings. The visualizations offer actionable insights that help hotel management teams optimize their operations, improve guest experience, and make data-driven decisions.

### Key Features

1. **Summary Metrics**:
   - **Average Stay Duration**: Average number of nights stayed by guests.
   - **Average Lead Time**: Time between booking and check-in.
   - **Total Bookings**: Overall count of bookings analyzed (119K bookings in total).

2. **Hotel-Specific Insights**:
   - Hotel-wise number of repeated guests.
   - Required car parking spaces for each hotel type (City Hotel vs. Resort Hotel).

3. **Booking Analysis**:
   - Distribution of bookings based on **meal type**, **deposit type**, and **distribution channel**.
   - Year-wise and monthly booking trends for better seasonal insights.

4. **Customer Insights**:
   - Customer types (transient, group, etc.) and their booking counts.
   - Analysis of canceled bookings to identify potential trends or issues.

5. **Room Allocation and Preferences**:
   - Comparison of assigned room types vs. reserved room types.
   - Booking counts segmented by reserved room type.

6. **Market Segment Analysis**:
   - Total guests segmented by market categories (online, corporate, travel agents, etc.).

7. **Financial Performance**:
   - Distribution channel-wise average daily rate (ADR) to understand profitability.

8. **Geographical Insights**:
   - Distribution of bookings by country, displayed on an interactive world map.

### Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For designing the interactive dashboard and creating visualizations.
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaned and processed data to derive meaningful metrics.
- **Microsoft Excel/CSV**: As the data source for the dashboard.

### File Structure

- **`Project_report_dashboard.pbix`**: Power BI file containing the dashboard and visualizations.
- **Screenshots**: A preview of the dashboard for quick reference.
- **Dataset**: Not included due to data sensitivity.



### Dataset Description

To replicate the dashboard, use a dataset with the following attributes:
- **Hotel Type**: City Hotel, Resort Hotel.
- **Booking Date**: Date of booking.
- **Meal Type**: BB (Bed & Breakfast), HB (Half Board), etc.
- **Market Segment**: Online, Corporate, Travel Agent, etc.
- **Lead Time**: Number of days between booking and check-in.
- **Reservation Details**: Assigned room type, reserved room type.
- **Cancellation Status**: Whether the booking was canceled.
- **Country**: Guestâ€™s country of origin.
- **Other Metrics**: Parking space requirements, repeated guest indicator.

### Objectives

- To create a detailed dashboard that helps hotel management:
  - Identify booking trends and customer behavior.
  - Optimize pricing strategies based on market and seasonal trends.
  - Improve resource allocation, such as parking spaces and room assignments.
  - Minimize booking cancellations by analyzing potential causes.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Power BI. The dashboard is tailored for the hospitality industry but can be adapted for similar use cases in other domains.

### Future Enhancements

- Integration of real-time booking data.
- Predictive analytics to forecast bookings and cancellations.
